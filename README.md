# 🔁 Transfer Learning with Pretrained CNNs (Image Classification)

## 📘 Overview

This notebook demonstrates how to leverage **transfer learning** to perform image classification by fine-tuning pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Instead of training from scratch, we use a pretrained model (such as VGG16) to benefit from learned features and reduce training time.

The goal is to showcase how pretrained models can be adapted for new tasks with minimal training, especially when working with smaller datasets.
